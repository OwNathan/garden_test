> [!timeline] 2057
> ### First Martian Colony
> - The European Space Agency (ESA) and two private corporations establish the first permanent human settlement on Mars.

> [!timeline] 2060s
> ### The Fusion Era Begins
> - In response to Earth's severe climate crisis, the widespread adoption of fusion power begins to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

> [!timeline] Late 2070s
> ### Humanity Becomes Extraplanetary
> - An economic boom, fueled by asteroid belt mining, solidifies humanity's presence across the Solar System.
> - The first facilities for antimatter extraction are established in Jupiter's orbit.

> [!timeline] 2109
> ### First Superluminal Flight
> - The first viable Alcubierre Drive prototype, powered by antimatter, successfully achieves faster-than-light (FTL) travel.

> [!timeline] c. 2117
> ### The Centaur Mission
> - The starship *Centaur* completes a round trip to Alpha Centauri in just over two years, proving interstellar colonization is feasible.

> [!timeline] 2134
> ### The First Terra Nova Fails
> - The first major extrasolar colonization mission, named Terra Nova, ends in disaster due to unexpectedly harsh planetary conditions and critical life-support failure.

> [!timeline] 2146
> ### The Second Terra Nova Succeeds
> - A new colony, also named Terra Nova, is successfully founded on a more suitable world.

> [!timeline] 2151
> ### Wormhole Communication is Theorized
> - Scientists theorize the use of microscopic wormholes for faster-than-light data transmission.

> [!timeline] 2158
> ### First Wormhole Stations are Built
> - The first wormhole communication relays are constructed, enabling near-instantaneous communication across human-colonized space.

> [!timeline] c. 2160
> ### The Second Colonial Age & A New Humanity
> - Worsening conditions on Earth and cheaper FTL travel trigger a mass exodus from the Solar System.
> - Genetic engineering becomes standard, effectively replacing baseline *Homo sapiens* with an enhanced human species with lifespans of 130-150 years.

> [!timeline] 2160 2230
> ### The Great Expansion
> - Hundreds of colonial expeditions depart for systems up to hundreds of light-years away, establishing a wide diaspora of human societies.

> [!timeline] 2175
> ### Widespread Genetic Reshaping
> - Most children are born with an improved genome, and adults can reshape their own at an increasingly lower cost.

> [!timeline] 2189
> ### N-Drives Become Commonplace
> - Due to mass production and lower costs, most of the population in developed systems is equipped with an N-Drive.

> [!timeline] c. 2221
> ### The Interplanetary Crisis
> - Earth's economy collapses due to mass emigration and the self-sufficiency of its former colonies, leading to renewed conflicts between terrestrial nations.

> [!timeline] 2230
> ### The Third World War
> - A conflict between the European Union and China escalates with the use of high-yield antimatter explosives, plunging the Solar System and its colonies into a devastating war.
> - The war results in 15 billion deaths, reducing the total human population from 17 billion to approximately 2 billion.
> - Earth's population plummets to under 200 million, the Moon is shattered, and Mars is rendered lifeless by a bioweapon.

> [!timeline] 2240 2400
> ### The Collapse
> - Interstellar travel and trade grind to a halt.
> - Countless colonies, cut off from support, fail and are lost.

> [!timeline] c. 2400
> ### Rise of the Intergalactic Community
> - As economies slowly recover, new interstellar powers emerge from the ashes, often led by "immortal" transhumanist elites.

> [!timeline] c. 2421
> ### The First Interstellar War
> - The Free League of Pasargad attempts a rapid, violent expansion to unify all of humanity under its rule.
> - The other major powers resist, leading to a bloody conflict that ends in a stalemate and a ceasefire.

> [!timeline] 2432
> ### The Present Day
> - The galaxy exists in a state of tense equilibrium. The major powers engage in proxy wars and skirmishes, often at the expense of independent colonies in the Outer Rim.
> - New political movements and communities form on the frontiers, opposing the established, centuries-old power structures of the Inner Sphere.
